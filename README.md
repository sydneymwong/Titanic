# Titanic Classifier

This repository contains work done for the Titanic Kaggle competition.  The issue is to predict whether or not a person survived the Titanic based on information about them, such as Sex, Age, Class, Fare, etc.

The predictions are binary so I have used a classification tree, random forest, and logistic regression.
